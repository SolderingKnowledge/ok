1 `npm install redux react-redux` intalling redux

2 `npm i redux-thunk`

3 `npm i axios`

4 `npm i react-router-dom`

5 `redux-devtools-extension`

6 `npm i moment` for date time formating

7 `npm i react-moment`

8 Proxy setup in `frontend/package.json`

```js
"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"

// using it this way
axios.post("/post");
```
Other way to do it without seting up `proxy` is to use CORS! Break the same origin policy:
```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const cors = require('cors');

app.use(cors());

// Or another way of  using:
const router = express.Router();
var cors = require('cors');
router.use(cors()); 
...
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
...
});

/* 
Adding cors is not a solution. You need to include the proxy "proxy" : "https://localhost:5000" in the package.json, you may need to restart or something or other-- but if you choose to use cors instead, you are allowing anyone to access your API. That means your database is wide open for people to poke around with. Passwords, emails, users, etc. It's all compromised.

## Notes:

1 This project was generated by `npx create-react-app <frontend>` so keep in mind that it is provided by `react-scripts` module.

2 First time you may run into issues where you generate react-scripts project and it starts complaining couldn't proxy from `localhost:3000` to `localhost:5000` in that case run it from backend folder and come back and rerun then it will stop complaining for making request to `favicon.ico` something like that.
